# University Admission Predictor

## Overview
This machine learning project predicts the likelihood of university admission based on applicants' academic and socioeconomic profiles. It explores how income, SAT scores, and other features influence acceptance rates.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (standardization, encoding, imputation)
- Multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP
- Cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curve analysis

## Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Load dataset and run `data_preprocessing.py`
2. Train models with `train_models.py`
3. Evaluate performance using validation pipeline and plots
